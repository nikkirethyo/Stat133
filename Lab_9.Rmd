**1.** To figure out the number of humans, we use the following command, which returns that there are 12 humans.

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | egrep human | cut -f 12 -d "," | uniq -c
``` 

**2.** To figure out the number of jedis, we use the following command, which returns that there are 6 jedi. 

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | egrep [^_]jedi | cut -f 11 -d "," | uniq -c
```

**3.** To return a list of the names of the jedis, we use the following command, which returns the names Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Dooku. 

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | egrep [^_]jedi | cut -f 1 -d "," 
```

**4.** Then to sort the names of jedis, we use: 

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | egrep [^_]jedi | cut -f 1 -d "," | sort
```

**5.** In order to find  the frequency of weapons, we use the following command, which tells us there are 5 blasters, 1 bowcaster, 1 force lightning, 7 lightsabers, 1 slugthrower, 1 spear, 4 unarmed. 

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | cut -f 13 -d "," | sort | uniq -c
```

**6.** In order to sort the above list, in order of ***decreasing*** frequencies, we use the command:

```{r eval = F}
head -21 stars.csv | tail -20 | cut -f 13 -d "," | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | sort -r
```
