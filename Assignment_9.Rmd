```{r echo = F}
library(rvest)
library(lubridate)
page <- "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors"
xpath <- '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/table' 
table_list <- page %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = xpath) %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)
```

**1.** Starting off with head(table_list[[5]]) we see that this table matches Austria's nuclear reactprs and from there can deduce that Japan's table is the 23rd in the list. 

```{r}
Japan <- table_list[[23]]
names(Japan)
```

**2.** To rename the columns of the table to appropriate names, we use the following: 

```{r}
Japan_names <- c("Name", "Reactor No.", "Type", "Model", "Status", "Net Capacity in MW", "Gross Capacity in MW", "Construction Start Date", "Commerical Operation Date", "Closure")
names(Japan) <- Japan_names
Japan <- Japan %>% filter(row_number() != 1)
```

**A Quick Visualization** 

To produce this graph, we use: 

```{r}
Japan %>% ggplot(aes(x=dmy(`Construction Start Date`),y=`Net Capacity in MW`, color = Type)) + geom_point() +labs(x="Construction Start Date")
```

**Construction Delays** 

```{r}
Japan %>% 
  mutate(Start = lubridate::dmy(`Construction Start Date`)) %>%
  mutate(End = lubridate::dmy(`Commerical Operation Date`)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Start,y=Name)) + geom_segment(aes(x=Start,y=Name,xend=End, yend=Name))

```

**PART 2** 

**1.** 
```{r eval=F}
mkdir lifespan
cd lifespan
```

**2.** 
```{r eval=F}
cd .. #this takes us back to home directory 
cd desktop #changes director to desktop where files are located 
mv lifeexpectancy.csv lifespan/lifeexpectancy.csv #moves lifeexpectancy.csv into lifespan directory 
mv makemaps-1.R lifespan/makemaps-1.R #moves makemaps-1.R into lifespan directory 
cd .. #goes back to home directory 
cd lifespan #changes to lifespan directory 
ls #will list the contents of lifespan, the two files you just placed there 
```

**3.**

```{r eval=F}
less lifeexpectancy.csv
```

**4.** 

The countries are contained in the first column, and we want to know how many rows (lines) there are. 

```{r eval=F}
cut -f 1 -d "," lifeexpectancy.csv | wc -l
```

**5.**

Doing the math we find that the corresponding column numbers are 1, 152, 177, and 202. 

**6.** 

To keep only the columns for these years, we use the following: 

```{r eval=F}
cut -f 1,152,177,202 -d "," lifeexpectancy.csv | head
```

**7.** 

In order to clean the file and rename it to lifeexpectancy.clean.csv, we use the following command. 

```{r eval=F}
cut -f 1,152,177,202 -d "," lifeexpectancy.csv | head | egrep "[0-9]" > lifeexpectancy.clean.csv
```

**8.** 

```{r eval=F}
R 
install.packages("maps")
install.packages("fields")
Ctrl D
