**1.** The vectorized calculation of this loop is the following: 
```{r}
vec = 1:50
vec[vec < 50]^2
```

**2.** 
```{r}
#a. The vector x will contain 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 from the following command
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 8, by = 2)
#b. This will make the values less than 4 of x equal to NA, thus you will have NA, NA, 4, 6, 8 
x[x < 4] <- NA 
#c. This will make all values of x equal to 0, giving you 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
x[] <- 0 
#d. This will make x a single value, rather than a vector, giving you just 0 
x <- 0
```

**3.** The lapply function in R operates on *vectors* and returns *lists*. 

**4.** 
a. Creating a vector containing the sum of squared entries in each row of m, using a for loop, we have: 
```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed(1337)
m <- matrix(runif(15000, -3, 3), ncol = 3)
```

```{r}
m.ssq.loop <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(m)){
    m.ssq.loop <- c(m.ssq.loop, sum(m[i,]^2))
}

head(m.ssq.loop)
```

b. Now, using the apply function instead, we have the following: 
```{r}
m.ssq.apply <- apply(m, 1, function(x){sum(x^2)})

head(m.ssq.apply)
```

c. For the sanity check, we simply use the identical function: 
```{r}
identical(m.ssq.loop, m.ssq.apply)
```

**5.** 
```{r echo = FALSE}
Year <- c(2000, 2001)
Algeria <- c(7, 9)
Brazil <- c(12, NA)
Columbia <- c(16, 18)

table1<- data.frame(Year, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia)
```
a. To wrangle the data from table1 into the object table2, we use the following: 
```{r}
#To take it from wide to narrow format
table2 <- table1 %>%
  gather(Country, Value, Algeria, Brazil, Columbia)
#To reorder the columns 
table2 <- table2[c("Country", "Year", "Value")]
table2
```

b. Now, to wrangle table2 into table 3, we use the following:
```{r}
table3 <- table2 %>%
  spread(Country, Value)

table3 %>% mutate(Average = rowMeans(table3[,2:4], na.rm = TRUE))

```

**6.** 
a. The glyphs in the Wage vs Education graph are points and the two lines as well. 

b. The aesthetics for the points are the location, namely the x and y of the glyph, and the color of the point. For the lines, similarly the location and color are its aesthetics. 

c. The variable sex is being mapped to the color aesthetic for both the points and lines and then the education level is being mapped to the x position and the wage level is being mapped to the y position for the glyphs. 

d. The variables education and wage level are both quantitative, but the variable sex is qualitative. 

e. The guides on this graph are the axes and then the legend for sex. 

f. To reconstruct this graph, we use the following: 
```{r}
suppressWarnings(print(ggplot(CPS85, aes(x = educ, y = wage, color = sex)) + geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,15)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,15)) + labs(title = "Wage vs. Education in CPS85") + theme(title = element_text(size = 20)) + geom_smooth(method = lm)))
```

**7.**
a. To write a function that takes in a string and outputs a vector of single character elements, we use the following:
```{r}
my.string <- "ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R"

SplitChars <- function(string){
  unlist(strsplit(string, ""))
}

SplitChars(my.string)
```

b. Now, we want to count the number of times an "a", "s", "R", or "r" appears in my.string: 
```{r}

count_asRr <- function(string){
  count <- 0
  for(letter in string){
    if(letter == "a" | letter == "s" | letter == "R" | letter == "r"){
      count <- count + 1
    }
  }
  return(count)
}

count_asRr(SplitChars(my.string))

```

c. Now, we want to write a function Reverse which reverses the order of a vector of single characters:
```{r}
reverse <- function(character_vec){
  rev(character_vec)
}

reverse(SplitChars(my.string))
```
